# ReQiew

### This was a design & code challenge for ST company.
You can find media of the resulting interfaces [here](https://drive.proton.me/urls/14T9K5SN2G#h8ubAKcubP8x) as well as the initially provided docs.

#### **To run project locally**:

- Clone this repository.
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
- Run `npm dev` to start the project.

The goal was to provide a prototype to be presented in order to get a green loght fot the project,
while making suggestions for improvements in UX/UI and data viualization.

### **Implemented suggestions for improvements**:

##### **Layout**:

- Make side navigation bar collapsible, thus allowing more space for the main content.
    - -> This allows for less cluttered UI leading to better visualization of the data.

- Bring navigation to the bottom of the page, facilitating access on mobile devices.
    - -> This also avoids reading flow to be interrupted from the main content on these smaller screens.

- Bring filters to a vertical bar on the right, allowing for a top to bottom flow through each filter.
    - -> This provides a more intuitive and user friendly experience.
    - -> Filters can be taken out of the way, when done with.
    - -> Acces on mobile devices is facilitated.

- Make layout responsive to different screen sizes.
    - -> This optimizes experience across devices.

##### **Data visualization**:

- Make use of colors to make intuitive sense of the data.
    - -> This allows for a better understanding of the data, without the need to return to the numbers every time.

- Add accent to main data points, to make them stand out.
    - -> This makes most relevant information easy to find on first glance.

##### **Interaction**:

- Make full CTA container clickable, instead of just the text.

- Add visual feedback to CTA container, to make it more intuitive that it is clickable.


#### **Disclaimer**:

There are still many things that could be improved, but I believe this is a good start.
